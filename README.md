The Press and Information Bureau (PIB) is critical to publicizing government policies and benefits, bridging government and media, and serving as the central archive for multimedia projects. This project develops PIB with media monitoring and advocacy as per the requirements of the Government of India. Initially, the system collected and classified news in various languages according to government roles and leaders, using sentiment analysis to analyze public opinion. A user-friendly dashboard provides instant notification of bad news to improve media coverage.
The GNC system uses the mBERT model to classify information into government categories. NCS includes advanced evaluation models to improve analysis, including the Twitter-Roberta-based sentiment model, the Bert-based multilingual-non-customized sentiment model, and the DistilBERT multilingual-based sentiment model.
The aim is to analyze the public's perspective on government-related news in different languages of the region. Using BERT and its derivatives, the system enables powerful text classification and sentiment analysis. This approach signifies PIB's dedication to using advanced technology for informed, data-driven communication and decision-making.
